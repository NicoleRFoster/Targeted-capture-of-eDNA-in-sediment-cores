# Radiocarbon dating results

### Output of radiocarbon (14C) dating results for each soil core. Radiocarbon ages are calibrated against the Southern Hemisphere calibration curve SHCal20. 
### Where marine influence is identified, a mixed SHCal20/Marine20 calibration is used. Marine calibrations included a local marine reservoir correction Î”R using
### https://delta-r-calc.jcu.io/ . Calibrations were done using OxCal 4.4.4 using a P-Sequence deposition model. 
### Calibrated ages provide both unmodelled and modelled age ranges and median values and refer to Cal BP where before present is 1950.
